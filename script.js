//*Loooping over arrays*

//How to use functions to go over arrays and manipulate their values whenever we want, like when we click a button.

//Output: This is the correct grade.

//Functions are useful when we want to execute reusable code. To access array elements using the searchGrade function, let's pass the grades array when calling the function.

let localisation = [48.89684744988406, 2.2918054818719025]

function searchLocalisation(localisation) {
	console.log(grades)
}

//Output: [ 48.89684744988406, 2.2918054818719025 ]

//If we want to access elements stored in multiple arrays using the same function, we pass the arrays as arguments when calling that function. Let's code the seconde array latitude, when calling searchPosition()

let latitude = [48.89684744988406, 48.89684744988407]
let longitude = [2.2918054818719025, 2.2918054818719026]

//once we've passed an array to a function, we can iterate over the array elements. Create a for loop to iterate through all grades elements.

function searchPlants(plants) {
	let len = plants.length
	for (let i = 0; i < len; i++) {}

function searchPens(pens) {
	for (let i = 0; i < pens.length; i++) {
		console.log(pens[i])

//By using a function, an array, and another parameter, we can do a lot. For example, let's search for the element 44 in the lights array by passing lights and then search to the searchLight function.

let searches = 44

function searchLight (lights, searches) {

//Arrow functions are type of anonymour function, meaning that they don't have a function name. If we want to call these functions, we need to store them insided a variable and call the variable with parentheses at the end

let game = () => {
	return "Mario"
}
console.log(game())

//With arrow functions, we don't need the function keyword or the function name. That means the first thing we start off is the parentheses but you don't have to add ";" at the end. 

function getCandy() {
	return "Haribo"
}

let candy = () => {
	return "Twix"
}

//Like with normal functions, we can add parametes insided the parentheses and then use the parameters insided the function.

function getFood(caddie) {
	return "trolley" + caddie
}

let shopping = (caddie) => {
	return "trolley" + caddie
}

console.log(shopping(" pasta"))

// Right after the parentheses and before the opening curly brace is where we add the arrow operator =>. We use this operator right before the code block or expression we want the functioon to execute.

//Just like with traditionnal functions, we use curly braces {} to contain an arrow function's code block.

//If an arrow function only has one statement, we can leave out both the curly braces and the return keywordd to get some very short code:

const coffee = () =>  "Orafio"

//Where ddo we add the arrow operator => : after the parentheses and before the opening curly brace

//What do curly braces {} do in an arrow function : they contain the code block 

//If we want to shorten the code remove the curly braces and the return keyword. 

//We call the arrow function with parentheses because it's necessary to say that we want the executed form.

const getVehiclesCount = () => 400
console.log(getVehiclesCount())

//*Arrow function with parameters

const getPrice = (discount) => 500 - (discount * 500)
console.log(getPrice(0.25))
//Output: 375

//Same as:

// let startingpoint = 500
// let sales = 0.25;

// function applySale(startingpoint, sales) {
// 		console.log(startingpoint - (sales * startingpoint))
// }
// console.log(applySale())

//Parameters in arrow functions are similar to parameters in normal functions. Code an arrow function that uses total as a parameter.
const getPrices = total => {
	const discount = 0.25
	return total - (discount * total)
}
console.log(getPrices(500))
//Output : 375

// In arrow functions, we don't have to add the parentheses if we have only one parameter, so "(total)" is the same as "total".

//Parameter values are set to undefined by default. If a function call doesn't pass a value the function will use undefined as the value.
//Call the getPrices() function below to see it display Nan, which means it's an undefined value.

const getTaxes = total => {
	const tax = 0.25
	return total + (tax * total)
}
console.log(getTaxes())
//Output: NaN

//To avoid undefined values, we specify the default value inside the parentheses. Set the default parameter value inside the parenthesis to total=200.

const getSales = (total = 500) => {
	const discount = 0.25
	return total - (discount * total)
}
console.log(getSales())
//Output : 375

//To use multiple parameters, we add the nex parameter in the parenthesis and seperate it from the rest by adding a comma ","

const getSalary = (total = 1200, discount = 5) => total - (discount / 100 * total)
console.log(getSalary())

//Arrow functions let us have more compact and concise code. How we write them depends on the parameters we use and the code block size. These functions will be essential later on when we'll use them in more complex code like React.

const getSizes = total => {
	const repair = 0.6
	return total - (repair * total)
}
console.log(getSizes(100))
//Output: 40

const getRatio = (nom, denom = 2) => {
	return nom / denom
}
console.log(getRatio(30, 2))
//Output: 15

const getSquare = (number = 0) => number * number
console.log(getSquare(5))
//Ouput: 25

const getArea = (length, width = 3) => length * width
console.log(getArea(5))
//Output: 15

//** Template literals**

//With template literals it's easier to addd variables and expressions inside of strings. Take a look below at how template literals achieve the same result as the longer method above it. 

let fruit = "peach"
console.log("I'm a " + fruit + "!")
console.log(`I'm a ${fruit}!`)

let cake = `Chocolate`
console.log(cake)

//To easily combine variables with string literals, we use the ${name} syntax where name is a variable 

let category = `pie`;
let pie =`${fruit} ${category}`
console.log(pie)
//Output: peach pie

//We can also perform operations inside a string literal by adding expressions inside the braces of ${}

let quantity = 20
let give = 10

let cost = `Total cost: ${quantity * give}`
console.log(cost)

//When calling a function, we leave out the parenthesis () if we're passing a string literal as an argument to the function. Let's pass the string literal Jane while calling the bike function

const bike = model => {
	return `I'm a ${model}`
}
console.log(bike`Giant`)

//**Classes**

//As we code complex programs, we'll need to create many similar but distinct objects. For example, all the books in the library. But creating a new object for thousands of books would take a lot of time and could lead to errors.

let book100 = {
	author: "Shakespear",
	title: "Da Vinci Code"
}
console.log(book100)

/* To make this process less error-prone and more efficient, we can use data structures called classes as templates.

* Once we create a template with the properties we'll want for all similar objects, we'll want for all similar objects, we can use it to create new objects faster.

* To create new objects, classes uppercase and classes need a special method called the constructor(). This method sets the property values for a new object.

* We need a way of specifying the unique values a new object will have. We do that by sending parameters to the constructor method. 

* Before creating a new object property, we need a special keyword: "THIS". We add the this keyword to refer to the object being created. */

class Book {
	constructor(author, title) {
		this.author = author
		this.title = title
	}
}

/* To create a new object property, we need to use the keyword this followed by a period and the property name. 

* To finish creating the new object property we'll assign the author parameter as a value to this.author. Same for title. 

* Time to use our class. We start the same way we'd create a variable but then add the "new" keyord followed by Book().

* Here we'll assign new Book() to the book1 variable. */

let book1 = new Book("Leo Tolstoy", "War and Peace")
console.log(book1)

let book2 = new Book("Dr. Seuss", "Oh, the Places You'll Go!")
console.log(book2)

//*Classes with method

//So far, the objects we've created from classes can't perform any actions. By adding methods to classes, we'll be able to create interactive objects using the classes as templates.

//Adding a method in a class is like creating a regular function, except there's no need for the function keyword. This VirtualPet class can't do much yet. Let's give it the ability to eat with a method.

class VirtualPet {
	constructor(name) {
		this.name = name
	}
	eat(food) {
		if (food === "treats") { 
		console.log("delicious")
	} else {
		console.log("oh no :(")
	}
}
}

let pet = new VirtualPet("Camille")
pet.eat("treats")

/* To use the eat() method, we'll need the name of the object, a period, the name of the method, and parentheses like so : pet.eat()

Parameters allow class methods to be more interactive by reacting to things we give them. Addd a parameter called food to the eat method.

With a confitionnal statement the objects we create will be able to react to the type of food we pass to eat() Finish adding the statement that checks if food is a particular value. 

Each new object of the VirtualPet class we create will be able to use the eat() method. Call eat() again but this time pass it "treats"
*/

//*Creating instances* 

//Everytime we create an object from a class, we're creating what's called an instance of that class. 

class Username {
	constructor(name) {
		this.name = name
		this.isOnline = true
	}
}
let user1 = new Username("Arya")
let user2 = new Username("Callyope")

//Each instance is independent. That means when we create a new instance, it doesn't affect any other instances.

user1.isOnline = false
console.log(user1)

// False again but Callyope is true set from the User class 

//Changing an instance also doesn't affect any other instances. Set user1.isOnline to false to see how changing a property from user1 doesn't affect the properties of user2.

//Because instances are independant they let us keep track of complicated data like a huge number of user on a website. We are gonna be keep track of 4 users and whether they're online.

class ActiveUsers {
	constructor(pseudo) {
		this.pseudo = pseudo
		this.active = true
	}
}

let active1 = new ActiveUsers("Don")
let active2 = new ActiveUsers("Mary")
let active3 = new ActiveUsers("Shaun")
let active4 = new ActiveUsers("Barry")

console.log(active1)
console.log(active2)
console.log(active3)
console.log(active4)

//When referring to an instance of a class, we are talking about a specific object createdd from a class template.

//if we changed the properties of an instance, only this instance would change. It wouldn't change anything to the class it was created from.

class Food {
	constructor(name, calories) {
		this.name = name
		this.calories = calories
	}
}
let banana = new Food("banana", 105)
let rice = new Food("rice", 50)
banana.calories = banana.calories / 2
console.log(banana)
console.log(rice)
