let game = () => {

// Right after the parentheses and before the opening curly brace is where we add the arrow operator =>. We use this operator right before the code block or expression we want the functioon to execute.

//Just like with traditionnal functions, we use curly braces {} to contain an arrow function's code block.

//If an arrow function only has one statement, we can leave out both the curly braces and the return keywordd to get some very short code:

const coffee = () =>  "Orafio"

//Where ddo we add the arrow operator => : after the parentheses and before the opening curly brace

//What do curly braces {} do in an arrow function : they contain the code block 

//If we want to shorten the code remove the curly braces and the return keyword. 

//We call the arrow function with parentheses because it's necessary to say that we want the executed form.

const getVehiclesCount = () => 400
console.log(getVehiclesCount())

//*Arrow function with parameters

const getPrice = (discount) => 500 - (discount * 500)
console.log(getPrice(0.25))
//Output: 375

//Same as:

// let startingpoint = 500
// let sales = 0.25;

// function applySale(startingpoint, sales) {
// 		console.log(startingpoint - (sales * startingpoint))
// }
// console.log(applySale())

//Parameters in arrow functions are similar to parameters in normal functions. Code an arrow function that uses total as a parameter.
const getPrices = total => {
	const discount = 0.25
	return total - (discount * total)
}
console.log(getPrices(500))
//Output : 375

// In arrow functions, we don't have to add the parentheses if we have only one parameter, so "(total)" is the same as "total".

//Parameter values are set to undefined by default. If a function call doesn't pass a value the function will use undefined as the value.
//Call the getPrices() function below to see it display Nan, which means it's an undefined value.

const getTaxes = total => {
	const tax = 0.25
	return total + (tax * total)
}

//To avoid undefined values, we specify the default value inside the parentheses. Set the default parameter value inside the parenthesis to total=200.

const getSales = (total = 500) => {
	const discount = 0.25

//** Template literals**

//With template literals it's easier to addd variables and expressions inside of strings. Take a look below at how template literals achieve the same result as the longer method above it. 

let fruit = "peach"

//To easily combine variables with string literals, we use the ${name} syntax where name is a variable 

let category = `pie`;
let pie =`${fruit} ${category}`

//Output: peach pie

//We can also perform operations inside a string literal by adding expressions inside the braces of ${}

let quantity = 20
let give = 10

let cost = `Total cost: ${quantity * give}`
console.log(cost)

//When calling a function, we leave out the parenthesis () if we're passing a string literal as an argument to the function. Let's pass the string literal Jane while calling the bike function

}
console.log(bike`Giant`)

//**Classes**

To make this process less error-prone and more efficient, we can use data structures called classes as templates.

* Once we create a template with the properties we'll want for all similar objects, we'll want for all similar objects, we can use it to create new objects faster.

* To create new objects, classes uppercase and classes need a special method called the constructor(). This method sets the property values for a new object.

* We need a way of specifying the unique values a new object will have. We do that by sending parameters to the constructor method. 

* Before creating a new object property, we need a special keyword: "THIS". We add the this keyword to refer to the object being created.
*/

		this.author = author
		this.title = title
	}
}

To create a new object property, we need to use the keyword this followed by a period and the property name. 

* To finish creating the new object property we'll assign the author parameter as a value to this.author. Same for title.

/*
So far, the objects we've created from classes can't perform any actions. By adding methods to classes, we'll be able to create interactive objects using the classes as templates.

*Adding a method in a class is like creating a regular function, except there's no need for the function keyword. This VirtualPet class can't do much yet. Let's give it the ability to eat with a method.

* Parameters allow class methods to be more interactive by reacting to things we give them. Addd a parameter called food to the eat method.

* With a conditionnal statement the objects we create will be able to react to the type of food we pass to eat() Finish adding the statement that checks if food is a particular value. 

* Each new object of the VirtualPet class we create will be able to use the eat() method. Call eat() again but this time pass it "treats"
*/

//*Creating instances* 

//Everytime we create an object from a class, we're creating what's called an instance of that class.

// False again but Callyope is true set from the User class 

//Changing an instance also doesn't affect any other instances. Set user1.isOnline to false to see how changing a property from user1 doesn't affect the properties of user2.

//When referring to an instance of a class, we are talking about a specific object createdd from a class template.

//if we changed the properties of an instance, only this instance would change. It wouldn't change anything to the class it was created from.

	}
}
let banana = new Food("banana", 105)
let rice = new Food("rice", 50)
banana.calories = banana.calories / 2
console.log(banana)
console.log(rice)

//Because instances are independant they let us keep track of complicated data like a huge number of user on a website. We are gonna be keep track of 4 users and whether they're online.

/* 
To recap : If we change the properties of a class, all instances created from that class, will have the same properties as the updated class

*We can add and update methods the same way we update class properties.

*Overriding a method replaces the code of the methodd in the superclass with that of the subclass.

*Call receiveDamage() method from the Wizard class to see what happends to the health property.

*If we need the behavior from the superclass's method, we can call it with the "SUPER" keyword. Type in the correct keyword to call the attack() method from the Human class.

To ovveride a method, we give it the same name andd parameters as the method in the superclass. We can override receiveDamage() from the superclass by coding the same method in the subclass.

*Overriding means that we can have the same method in the subclass but customize its behavior for what's needed in the subclass.

*When we call receiveDamage() method on human and wizard we'll see their simular behavior but different result (90, 95)

*To customize the method in the subclass, we want a method that ovveride a method from a superclass. 

*The subclass method needs to have the name and parameters in common with the superclass method when overriding it.

*A subclass can't still use the original superclass'method once it overrides it. When calling that method by its name without super, the sunbclass will use the overriding method.

//A superclass can't use the properties of a subclass.

//**Object-oriented Programming, a style of coding used by developers to model real-life objects

//*Encapsulating objects

//Before anything, a simple functionnal programm, FP paradigm:

function getDistance(mph, h) {
	return mph * h
}
let mph = 60
let h = 2
let distance = getDistance(mph, h)
console.log(distance)

//Then, object oriented programming, OOP paradigm. In this style, we group data and functionality as properties and methods inside objects. Add a property called hungry and a method called eat to our virtual cat object:

let miaou = {
	hungry: true,
	eat: function() {
		miaou.hungry = false
	}
}
miaou.eat()
console.log(miaou.hungry)

//OOP is useful for modeling real-life objects, which have properties and functions that we treat as one package, like a car for example. Let's model an automobile by creating an object with a mileage property and a drive() method. One style is not a replacement for the other, and we often need to use both FP & OOP when programming, depending on what we need to do.

let automobile = {
	mileage: 4000,
	drive: function(miles) {
		automobile.mileage += miles
	}
}
automobile.drive(300)
console.log(automobile.mileage)
//Output: 4300

function addMoney(value, amount) { 
	return value + amount
}

let value = 0
value = addMoney(value, 100)
value = addMoney(value, 50)
value = addMoney(value, 22)

console.log(value)
//Output 172

//Let's start by creating a value property that can be easily updated and setting it to 0

let myPiggy = {
	value: 0,
	addMoney: function(amount) {
		myPiggy.value = myPiggy.value + amount
	}
}
myPiggy.addMoney(100)

//Output: 100

/*
In OOP, we group together related data and functions in the same object. We call this encapsulation, and it's a key principle of OOP.

*For having a code encapsulated, we need to have variables and functions grouped together in one object. 

*We have to identify which methods and properties belong together and which should be addedd to other objects in our code.

*Though encapsulation methods can access properties that belong to the same object. Here the drive(miles) method has to access to the mileage property.

*To recap: Encapsulation is grouping related data and functions in the same object.

Let's take a look at another key concept: inheritance, previously covered when learning about JavaScript classes.

*When we create objects one by one we run into the problem of having duplicate code. We use inheritance to make our code efficient. 

*Through inheritance, objects receive methods from other objects and classes. Inheritance lets us create oobjects that have different properties and behaviors without coding each one from scratch.

*One way to apply inheritance is by creating objects from other objects. Code Object.create() for addding a template object in parentheses.
*/

let person1 = {
	greet: function() {
		console.log("Hi")
	}
}

let person2 = {
	greet: function() {
		console.log("Hi")
	}
}
//Here, they are 2 methods. 

//One way to apply inheritance is by creating objects from other objects. Code "Object.create()" and add the template object in parentheses.

let template1 = {
	greet: function() {
		console.log("Hi!")
	}
}
let person3 = Object.create(template1)

//The person object has now inherited the template object's methods and can use them as its own. Try calling greet() as a methodd of person 

person3.greet()
//Output: Hi!

//Objects don't actually own inherited methods but borrow them. To prove this, display the new "person" object to see it's empty.
console.log(person3)
//Output: <prototype>: Object { greet: greet() }

//If we need more methods for an object, we can set them directly.

let car = {
	startEngine: function() {
		console.log("Starting engine")
	}
}

let hybrid = Object.create(car)

hybrid.charge = function() {
	console.log("Using fuel to charge battery")
}

hybrid.startEngine()
hybrid.charge()

//When using Object.create() property values aren't inherited either. Display the player1 object to see it doesn't have a name value set.

let player = {
	name: "Player",
	greet: function() {
		console.log("Ready to play")
	}
}

let player1 = Object.create(player)
player1.name = "Jill" //Just like with methods, we can set properties directly. Set the name to Jill for the player2 object, "Player" is first here. 

console.log(player1)
//Output: <prototype>: Object { name: "Player", greet: greet() }



//** 
//We took a look at an interesting way of applying inheritance in JavaScript with Object.create(). Although useful, this is not the most common approach. We'll take a look at how inheritance works with classes.

let car1 = {
	displayMiles: function() {
		console.log("0 miles driven")
	}
}

let porshe = Object.create(car1)
let bmw = Object.create(car1)
let jaguar = Object.create(car1)

porshe.displayMiles()
bmw.displayMiles()
jaguar.displayMiles()

/*
To recap:

*Object to object inheritance can be described as objects that can use methods stored in a template object. 

*Objects don't own their inherited methods.

*Inheritance make our OOP code more efficient because it lets us write a method once and use it with many objects.
*/

let speaker = {
	play: function() {
		console.log("Playing audio")
	}
}

let alexa = Object.create(speaker)

alexa.listen = function() {
	console.log("Listening")
}
//The new object alexa inherit only the play() method. 

let car3 = {
	drive: function() {
		console.log("Vroom")
	}
}

let myCar = Object.create(car3)
console.log(myCar)

let player3 = {
	fight: function() {
		console.log("Take that")
	}
}

let wizard1 = Object.create(player3)
wizard1.castSpell = function() { //add a new method to the new wizard object.
	console.log("Alohomora!")
}
wizard1.fight()
wizard1.castSpell()

/* Applying inheritance in OOP pt2

*We're previously learned how to use classes to make our code more efficient. Every class contains a method called a constructor that sets the properties of new objects, known as instances.

*Creating objects out of classes is a great example of using inheritance to write short efficient code

*Writing OOP code with classes requires planning. Let's take a look at how a developer would plan their code in the following situation. Suppose we wanted to model students in the following code:
*/

//We've decided "Student" objects should work exactly like "User", but also have a property called "major". If we create a new "Student" class, we end up repeating a lot of code from "User". Which parts are repeated ? : The assignment of the name and age properties and the greet() method. 

class Users {
	constructor(name, age) {
		this.name = name
		this.age = age
	}
	greet() {
		console.log("Hi, I study " + this.major)
	}
}
/*
class Student {
	constructor(name, age, major) {
		this.name = name,
		this.age = age,
		this.major = major
	}
	greet() {
		console.log("Hii")
	}
}

*Instead, it makes more sense to create a subclass that inherits User's greet() method. To do that, code extends Users. Once we've created a subclass, we make sure the Student class also has the properties of Users by coding the super keyword with the classes they want to share.

*After we've created a subclass that has all the properties of the superclass, we can add the additional properties we need like major.
*/

//We can now create objects that own properties and inherit methods form both Student and Users. A key part of writing OOP code is figuring out effective ways of applying inheritance. 

class Student extends Users {
	constructor(name, age, major) {
		super(name, age)
		this.major = major
	}
}

let student1 = new Student("Sam", 25, "chemistery")
let student2 = new Student("Ann", 25, "architecture")
let student3 = new Student("ZoÃ©", 25, "maths")

console.log(student1)
student1.greet()
student2.greet()

class Phone {
	constructor(provider) {
		this.provider = provider
	}
	call(contact) {
		console.log("Calling " + contact)
	}
}

let phone1 = new Phone ("AT&T")
// The property AT&T is only displayed because call() is inherited, for having the method you should call it.
console.log(phone1) 
//Output: Object { provider: "AT&T" }

phone1.call("Mia")
//Output: Calling Mia

class Employees {
	constructor(compagny) {
		this.compagny = compagny
	}
	mission() {
		console.log("Hi, I'm capable of " + this.language)
	}
}

class Developper extends Employees {
	constructor(compagny, language) {
		super(compagny)
		this.language = language
	}
}
let employee1 = new Developper("Google", "python")
let employee2 = new Developper("Amazon", "sql")

console.log(employee1)
console.log(employee2)

employee1.mission()
employee2.mission()

class Reviewer {
	read() {
		console.log("Lecture")
	}
}
class Writer extends Reviewer {
	edit() {
		console.log("Edition")
	}
}

let control1 = new Writer() //He can both read and edit.
let control2 = new Reviewer() // He's reading only.

console.log(control1.edit, control1.read)
console.log(control2.read, control2.edit) //edit is undefined here!

//*Abstracting Objects

//Model a complicated object, like a car in JavaScript: when we're driving, we don't have to interact with the mechanics of the car at every level. The same goes for code. We don't interact with every method or property. We want to interact with a few cire parts that control the rest. A car does a lot of things as the same time. For example, a car injects and ignites fuel thousands of times a minute just to stay running.

class Car {
	injectFuel() {
		console.log("Spraying fuel")
	}
	igniteFuel() {
		console.log("Boom")
	}
}

let acar = new Car()
acar.injectFuel()
acar.igniteFuel()
acar.injectFuel()
acar.igniteFuel()

//If we had to always make low-level method calls to control an object, our code would be very hardd to read and use. Besides that, managing each-low level method call by oourselves increases the chance we'll make a mistake and cause unwanted effects.

acar.injectFuel()
acar.injectFuel()
acar.igniteFuel()

//Cars do all of this low-level fuctionality for us, and we only have to start them up. Hidding these details is called abstraction. We'll implement abstraction in OOP by writing a few core functions that handle all of the low-level work.

class Car1 {
	constructor(start) {
		this.on = true
	}
	stepOneFuel() {
		console.log("Injecting fuel")
	}
	stepTwoFuel() {
		console.log("Fuel consummed")
	}
	honk() {
		console.log("Honk")
	}

	startUp() {
		this.on = false //If on, infinite loop
		while (this.on) {
			this.stepOneFuel()
			this.stepTwoFuel()
		}
	}
}

class Mitsubishi extends Car1 {
	constructor(start) {
		super(start)
	}
}

let  eclipseCross = new Mitsubishi()

eclipseCross.startUp()
//Output: Injecting fuel, Fuel consummed....infinite....

//Abstraction allows other developers to use our class without having to know what low-level methods it has or how they even work. Other developpers can create a new object from our "Car1" class and use it by just calling a few core methods.

//To recap: Abstraction is simplifying how we interact with objects down to a few methods. We implement it by writing a few core methods that handle low-level functions.

//A core method is like takePhoto() not closeShutter() for example

//Abstract this class by creating a makeCoffee() method that heats water, adds it to coffee grouds and filters off the coffee:
class Coffeemaker {
	heatWater() {
		console.log("Heating water")
	}
	brew() {
		console.log("Adding water to grounds")
	}
	filter() {
		console.log("Filtering coffee")
	}
	makeCoffee() {
		this.heatWater()
		this.brew()
		this.filter()
	}
}

let coffeeMaker = new Coffeemaker() 
coffeeMaker.makeCoffee()
//Output: Heating water Adding water to grounds Filtering coffee

//To make ice cream, we must both churn and freeze cream. Call the method of iceCreamMaker that doeas both for us:

class IceCreamMaker {
	churn() {
		console.log("Churning cream")
	}
	freeze() {
		console.log("Freezing cream")
	}
	makeIceCream() {
		this.churn()
		this.freeze()
	}
}

let iceCreamMaker = new IceCreamMaker()
iceCreamMaker.makeIceCream()
//Output: Churning cream Freezing cream

//Code the translateLive() method so that travelers using your app can instantly translate their audio into another language.

class Translator {
	record() {
		console.log("Recording audio")
	}
	transcribeRecording() {
		console.log("Converting audio to text")
	}
	translateText() {
		console.log("Translating text")
	}
	translateLive() {
		this.record()
		this.transcribeRecording()
		this.translateText()
	}
}
let translateme = new Translator()
translateme.translateLive()
//Output: Recording audio Converting audio to text Translating text

//Call the correct core method that handles the low-level functionality of changing slides after displaying each one:

class Slideshow {
	constructor(slides) {
		this.slides = slides
		this.current = 1
	}
	viewNextSlide() {
		this.current++
	}
	play() {
		while (this.current <= this.slides) {
			console.log('Slide ' + this.current)
			this.viewNextSlide()
		}
	}
}

let slideShow = new Slideshow(5)
slideShow.play()

//Output: Slide 1 Slide 2 Slide 3 Slide 4 Slide 5

//*Polymorphic Objects

/* To make our code easier to use, we want to keep the same method calls for different objects, even if they have slighly different behaviors:

car.displayAlert() // Output: Warning: Fuel low
elecrtricCar.displayAlert() //Output: Warning: Battery low

*Sometimes inherited methods won't make sense without adapting them, like displaying a fuel warning for an electricCar object.


class GasCar {
	displayAlert() {
		console.log("Fuel low")
	}
	startNavigation() {
		console.log("Select destination")
	}
}

let electricalCar = new GasCar()
electricalCar.diplayAlert()
//Output: Fuel low

*In OOP, objects can have the same method calls but different behaviors. We call that polymorphism.

*As a example, all three instances below inherit the honk() method but produce different sounds.
*/

let prius = new Car1()
let kia = new Car1()
let tesla = new Car1()

prius.honk()
kia.honk()
tesla.honk()
//Output: Honk, Honk, Honk

//With a simple method inherited, they'll honk the same sound three times.

//To apply polymorphism and change how objects behave, we override object methods with the right behavior.

class ClassicCar {
	alertOpenDoor() {
		console.log("Open 4 doors")
	}
	lockDoors() {
		console.log("Locking 4 doors")
	}
}

class Coupe extends ClassicCar {
	lockDoors() {
		console.log("Locking 2 doors")
	} 
}

let myNewCar = new ClassicCar()
let myNewCoupe = new Coupe()

myNewCoupe.alertOpenDoor()
//Output: Open 4 doors !

//Similarly, we override subclass methods when needed. Code lockDoors() to override the method:

myNewCoupe.lockDoors()
//Output: Locking 2 doors

//Through polymorphism, we can call on object methods knowing that they have the correct behavior set. Not having to remember different method names for each unique behavior makes our code easy to use and maintain.

myNewCar.lockDoors()
//Output: Locking 4 doors
myNewCoupe.lockDoors()
//Output: Locking 2 doors

class Personnality {
	greet() {
		console.log("Hello")
	}
}

class Professor extends Personnality {
	greet() {
		console.log("Salutations")
	}
}

let professor = new Professor()

professor.greet = function() {
	console.log("Good news, everyone !")
}
professor.greet()

//First, it was Hello, then Professor erase it with Salutations, and then we attributed Good news... to the same greet function and actualized it.

//Override the inherited method so that premium.playVideo() doesn't show any ads:

class MyUser {
	playVideo() {
		console.log("Ad #1: Shaving cream 9,99$")
	} 
}

let premium = new MyUser()
premium.playVideo = function () {
	console.log("You've successfuly connected: Buffering HD Video")
}

premium.playVideo()

//To recap: Polymorphism is when objects have the same method call but different behaviors.

//Both instances and subclasses can overridde their inherited methods.

//**Dynamic Webpages**

//*Interacting with Webpages with html5

/*

*Behind every dynamic and responsive website there's some JavaScript code. On this webpage, JavaScript changes the text when you click the reverse button and reverse the order of the letters.

*To add JavaScript code to a webpage, we start with the script tags. It's the LAST ELEMENT BEFORE CLOSING THE BODY TAG in the HTML structure.

*To tell the elements how to respond to, say, the click of a button, we need a way of interacting with them : the first step in doing that is giving each element an ID ! All IDD values are unique ! They identify HTML elements and help us to interact with them using JavaScript

*First instruction, id #index inside parentheses
document.getElementById("index")

*To make changes to the text between the tags we need to retrieve it with .innerHTML. It gives us the text.
*/

console.log(document.getElementById("index").innerHTML)
//Output: First instruction

//After we retrieve it, we can update it by using the equal sign followed by a value that we picked.

document.getElementById("index").innerHTML = "Second instruction"
//Output: direct change in HTML : Second instruction override First instruction

/*
To recap:

*innerHTML is for accessing the text of an element.

*document.getElementById retrieves the tags and the text of an HTML element
*/

//*Using variables in Webpages

//We can create variables like let element and use them to store the HTML element we access. We store the element we're accessing through document.getElementById() using a variable.

let element = document.getElementById("index")

//Now the element variable stands for what's in the document.getElementById("index"). We can access the text of the paragraph through the variable element by using .innerHTML

console.log(element.innerHTML)
//Output: Second Instruction
//We can also use the variable to update the paragraph's content, by adding equal sign and the new value "Third instruction". 

//let element = document.getElementById("index")
element.innerHTML = "Third instruction" 
//It will override First instruction, then skip Second Instruction for Third Instruction.

console.log(element.innerHTML)
//Output: Third Instruction

//*Creating Elements

let bodyElement = document.getElementById("parent") 
//First instruction, therefore the DOM can't access property "appendChild" and bodyElement is null...

//Creating new elements with JS, like when users click the Show Message button, makes for flexible and user-friendly webpage.  Start with a variable named paragraph to store the element we want to create. Create a specific element by coding its name surrounded by quotes. p for create a paragraph

let paragraph = document.createElement("p")

//The element stored in paragraph has no text so we need paragraph.innerHTML to change that. To set the text of the new paragraph, code an equal sign followed by a string value:

paragraph.innerHTML = "I'm a paragraph injected"

//We use a variable to store an element we create for make our code more readable.

//Created elements don't automatically display. We'll learn later how to make them show up.
console.log(paragraph)

//*Nesting Elements

/*
Now that we know how to create elements using JS, we can learn how to nest andd display them.

*When nesting an element like the "p" element inside the "body element", "body" becomes the PARENT of "p", so "p" is the CHILD of "body"

*First, in the HTML code, set an id to the body so we can nest a new element inside of it.

*Inside the script, create a variable to store body element using let bodyElement.

*Then access the body element using document.getElementById("parent")

*To nest an element inside the bodyElement, we use bodyElement.append(paragraph)
*/

//let bodyElement = document.getElementById("parent")
bodyElement.append(paragraph)

/*
To recap: 

*Be careful: we need to set before we can create an element, the ID of the created element's parent ! 

*It's a good idea to store the parent element in a variable when accessing it to avoid rewriting the instruction when we need the parent.
*/

//*Removing Elements

//We need a new function to remove elements when users click the button for example.

//To remove the p element fromt the body, bodyElement.removeChild is the correct instruction.

//bodyElement.removeChild(paragraph)

//Remember we don't create variables for the element we want to remove, create or the parent for access these elements, it's only for make the code more readable.

let list1 = document.getElementById("list")
let ingredient1 = document.getElementById("flour")
let ingredient2 = document.getElementById("sugar")

list1.removeChild(ingredient2)

//*Including a script

/*
*To make creating interactive webpages even easier we can use seperate files to add JavaScript and HTML

*<script src="script.js"></script> in the HTML

*Without addditional information, a button tag is useless. To react to clicks from visitors, a button tag needs the onclick attribute.

*<button onclick>Publish webstie</button>

*The onclick attribute can call functions from an included script when a visitor clicks on : onclick="sayHello()"

*Using .innerHTML, we can make the sayHello() function change the content of the paragraph a visitor clicks on the button. 
*/

function sayHello() {
	document.getElementById("info").innerHTML = "Website published!"
}

//Getting User Input

/*
Websites come to life with user input: when visitors add comments, send messages, or share posts with their friends :

*We've learned before that we get user input with the input element: single tag like this: <input>

*input elements can only be text fields with a sigle line. To create a multiple-line text area use <textarea></textarea>

*To control the size, rows attribute rows="6", cols attribute cols="15"

*For the placeholder same: placeholder="My Placeholder"

*To access user input from an included script, we need to add .value at the end of document.getElementById()

let mimo = document.getElementById("mimoInput").value
console.log(mimo)
Output: Miaou : If I type Miaou in the input!

*After accessing user input, we can use it like any other value.

*Knowing how to get user input, we can use it to update a webpage. Assemble the code so that the value of mimo appears on the webpage when clicking on the Register button
*/

function register() {
	let mimo = document.getElementById("mimoInput").value
	document.getElementById("success").innerHTML = mimo + ", you're signed up!"
	console.log(mimo)
}

//Accessing user input from a textarea element works the same way. Code .value after accessing the textarea element.

function addReview() {
	let review = document.getElementById("reviewText").value
	let addedReview = document.getElementById("addedReview")
	addedReview.innerHTML = review
	console.log(review)
}

function ask() {
	let question = document.getElementById("questionInput").value
	console.log(question)
}

//We need a button and a function to access user input from an input element because the element's value changes when a user interacts with it

function share() {
	let post = document.getElementById("postText").value
	console.log(post)
}

//Set the content of the paragraph to searchWord, the variable that stores the value of the input element.
function searchMe() {
	let searchWord = document.getElementById("searchInput").value
	document.getElementById("area").innerHTML = searchWord
} 

//**The Document Object Model**

//*The HTMM Document Tree

/*
Previously, we've seen how we can access HTML elements by their ID with getElementById, the id and innerHTML

*We can also find elements by their location in the HTML document.

console.log(document.body.firstElementChild.innerHTML)

*This displays the entire HTML document that the DOM is rendering.

*To find elements by their location, we need to be able to visualize the HTML document as a tree structure

*First HTML then body then h1, p etc...

*Tree data structures like the one below are commonly used in programming to represent data and relationships in a hierarchical way.

*We can access elements that don't have an ID by their POSITION in the HTML tree structure. 

*We call each element of a tree a node. "html" is the root node, the start of the tree.

*Elements like "p" are called element nodes. 
We consider the text inside text nodeds even though it doesn't have th "<" and ">"
*/

//*HTML Tree Node Relations, how nodes relate to each other.

/*
We refer to nodes as being in a parent-child relationship if they are connected and there are no other nodes between them.

*We create a child node by nesting an element inside another. The "p" element is inside the body element so it's a child of "body":

<body>
	<h1>Puzzles</h1>
	<p>Landscape</p>
</body>

*If a "li" is nested inside a "ul", li is not directy inside body, so its node PARENT is "li" instead of "body"

*A node is descendant of another node, if there is a connection between them, even if there are other nodes in between. Here, all nodes are dedscendants of the html node:
html > body > p > text

*We create descendant nodes by nesting elements inside each other. The "li" inside the "ul" which is inside "body". "li" is a DESCENDANT of "body"

*Two nodes are siblings if they share the same parent like "h1" and "p"

*Here, "h1" and "p" are sibling nodes because they appear nested inside the same parent "body".

*So the ul element is a child of the body. "body" is a descendant of "body" because all children are descendants

*Nodes are siblings when they descendant of the same node

*PARENT/SIBLINGS/DESCENDANT

//*The Document Object Model

/*
The principle is to have easy access to HTML elements based on their position in the HTML document's tree representation

*The DOM is a javasript INTERFACE that allows us to access HTML elements based on their position in the HTML document's tree

*Before we start accessing elements with JavaScript we need to add a script element. The first thing the DOM allows us to do is access the root HTML node with javascript keyword "document"
*/

let htmlRoot = document

//Just like we access object properties, we can access the child nodes of the html nodde with .head and .body

let theHead = document.head
let theBody = document.body

console.log(theHead)
console.log(theBody)

/*
We can then update the nodes with .innerHTML

theBody.innerHTML = "Where did the page go"

*To get all the children nodes of a node, we use the .children property. This gives us an array of the child nodes in order of appearance. 

let bodyChildren = document.body.children
bodyChildren[0].innerHTML = "Who changed my heading?"

*We can access the first child node of a parent with .firstElementChild 

let heading = document.body.firstElementChild
heading.innerHTML = "Changing heading"

*We can access the nearest sibling of an element node with .nextElementSibling

let theBody1 = document.head.nextElementSibling
theBody1.innerHTML = "Page deleted"

*For example, accessing the "p" when there a two children in the body element would be : document.body.children[1]

*Here document.head.nextElementSibling is body:
html
head
title
body
h1
ol
li
ol
body
html

*Here, assign p:
html
head
title
body
h1
p
body
html

document.body.firstElementChild.nextElementSibling.innerHTML = "I'm changing the p"
*/

//**Querying Webpages

//*Querying Specific Selectors*

//If we want to retrieve individual HTML elements, we use the querySelector() method.

function publish() {
	let element1 = document.querySelector("#p")
	element1.innerHTML = "Website published"

}

/*
To select a specific element, we add a selector inside parentheses, like coding "p" if we want to get the paragraph below the button. 

*It works with all selectors, like tags, classes, and ID's. (# ID, . class, tags p)

*querySelector only retrieves the first element it finds. If we have two elements with the same tag or class, we only access the first one. 

h3 * only me
h3
h3
querySelector("h3") 

To recap : Only the first HTML element that matches its search is what does the querySelector() method access.

For accessing a different element of the SAME class, we can specify the tag then the class if a class is shared by different tags.

*If the tags has multiple classes, we can add the other class right after the first.  (".firstclass.secondclass")
*/

//*Setting attributes dynamically

/*
How to change HTML attributes with JS, just like we're changing the src attribute on each button press in this example of picture profile when click a button, changed.

*Once we've accessed an element with JavaScript, we can get its attributse by adding a "." followed by the attribute name.

*For example, after we've stored an "img" element inside the "element2" variable, we write "element2.src" to get the attribute value.
*/

function showAttribute() {
	let element2 = document.querySelector("img")
	console.log(element2.src)
}

function changeAttribute() {
	let element3 = document.querySelector("img")
	element3.src = "https://mimo.app/r/kittles.png"
	console.log(element3)
}

//We can even use attributes to change how eleents work and behave on a webpage.

function changeQuestionType() {
	let element4 = document.querySelector("#range")
	element4.type = "checkbox"
} 

//Changing the right attributes can be very powerful. Change this webpage's entire look by setting a style sheet:

function darkMode() {
	let element5 = document.querySelector("#actualstyle")
	element5.href = "style2.css"
}

//We access an element's attribute after we've stored the element inside a variable, by cooding a period followed by the attribute name.

//You can also set the input element type andd placeholder attributes element.placeholder = "MyPlaceholder"

function showColor() {
	let element6 = document.querySelector(".redcolor")
	element6.style.color = "#FFDAB9"
	console.log(element6.style.color)
}

/*
el.style.borderRadius = "45px"
el.style.backgroundColor = "blue"
el.style.border = "5px solid lightGray" 
*/

//*Getting and Setting Attributes

/*
How to use JS methods to change HTML attributes? (Element.getAttribute() method)

*Before changing the attribute, we'll use the querySelector to store the img element inside the element7 variable.

*We'll want to access the img element's src attribute and store it. Let's store it in a new variable called imageLink

*To get an attribute's value, we have to use the getAttribute() method.

*Inside the parentheses, we specify which attribute value we want. Here, we'll code src inside quotes to get the image link.

*We can confirm we got the value by printing the imageLink variable to the console. 
*/

function displayAttribute() {
	let element7 = document.querySelector("#cat")
	console.log(element7)
	let imageLink = element7.getAttribute("src")
	console.log(imageLink) //Does the same thing as element7, but with imageLink we act with element7 and focus on the src attribute
}

//getAttribute() also works if we want to get all the attributes values, like multiple style ones for example:

function displayMultipleStyles() {
	let element8 = document.querySelector("#pokemonlink")
	let imageStyle = element8.getAttribute("style")
	console.log(imageStyle)
} 
displayMultipleStyles()
//Output: color: #FFDAB9; font-size: 1.3rem;

/*
Now that we've learned how to access attributes, let's learn how to change them (setAttribute())

*Here, we have the "img" element stored inside the element9 variable. To set an attribute, we use the setAttribute() method after the variable name.

*Inside the parentheses, we first have to specify which attribute we want to set, like src in our case.

*Next, we want to provide the new value for src. We add the new value after a comma and inside quotes. Both the attribute we want to change and the new value. First the attribute and then the value.

*Let's display element9.getAttribute("#cat") again to see that the web address actually changed.
*/

function changeImage() {
	let element9 = document.querySelector("#cat")
	element9.setAttribute("src", "https://mimo.app/r/kittles.png")
	console.log(element9.getAttribute("src"))
}
//Output: https://mimo.app/r/kittles.png
changeImage()

function changeType() {
	let element10 = document.querySelector("#mimoInput")
	element10.setAttribute("type", "range")
}

function updateElement() {
	let element11 = document.querySelector("#mimoInput")
	element10.setAttribute("placeholder", "MyPlaceholder")
}

//*Getting Tags and Classes

/* 
So far we've only looked at ways of accessing one element at a time with methods like getElementById() or querySelector(). 

*But what if we want to access more than one element at a time? For example, what if we wanted to count items in a list?

*We can get a COLLECTION of elements of the same tag type with getElementsByTagName()

*Collections are similar to ARRAYS. They work with indices that start from 0. DDisplay the first element's HTML content.

*Just like with arrays, we can also access the length property of a collection 

*/

function displayItem() {
	let element11 = document.getElementsByTagName("li")
	console.log(element11[0].innerHTML)
	console.log(element11.length)
}
displayItem()
//Output : Flour
//When console.log only the variable element11, it just displays the entire collection of all lists that existed in the HTML. All tags. It returns a collection of elements that have the same tag.

//If we want to return a collection that contains specific elements of a class, we can use the getElementsByClassName() method instead.

function displayTasks() {
	let element12 = document.getElementsByClassName("urgent")
	console.log("You have " + element12.length + " tasks")
}
displayTasks()
//Output: You have 5 tasks.

//Since getElementsByClassName() also returns a collection, we can then access each element through the index. Display the first urgent task.

function displayItems() {
	let element13 = document.getElementsByClassName("urgent")
	console.log(element13[3].innerHTML)
}
displayItems()
//Call John

//To access multiple elements that have mmore than one class, we just add the classes with a space in between (in HTML: class="urgent, important") (in JS: getElementsByClassName("urgent important"))

function displayMultipleClasses() {
	let element14 = document.getElementsByClassName("list urgent")
	console.log(element14.length)
}
displayMultipleClasses()

//*Querying Multiple Elements

//So far we've only been able to retrieve multiple elements if they had the same tag or class name.

function displayH3() {
	let element15 = document.getElementsByTagName("h3")
	console.log(element15[0].innerHTML)
}
displayH3()
//Output: Breaking News

//There's also another more powerful way of getting array-like lists of elements, and that's with the querySelectorAll() method:

function displayAllH3() {
	let element16 = document.querySelectorAll("h3")
	console.log(element16[2].innerHTML)
}
displayAllH3()
//Output: The New Y-Phone

//The great thing about querySelectorAll() is that it works for both tag and class names.

function displayUrgentItems() {
	let element17 = document.querySelectorAll(".urgent")
	console.log(element17)
}
displayUrgentItems()
//Output: NodeList(6) [ li.list,.urgent, li.list,.urgent, li.list,.urgent, li.list,.urgent, li.urgent, li.urgent ]

//We can also use querySelectorAll to look for specific elements, like a h3 element of a class "news"

function displayNewsItems() {
	let element18 = document.querySelectorAll("h3.news")
	console.log(element18)
}
displayNewsItems()
//Output: NodeList(3) [ h3.news, h3.news, h3.news ]

//querySelectorAll() lets us do more advance searches like accessing elements of two different classes at the same time. In this example, we're looking for elements of either class movie or tech. To get elements that belong to 2 different classes, we just add one class after the other separated by a comma.

function displayMovieAndTech() {
	let element19 = document.querySelectorAll(".movie, .tech, h3")
	console.log(element19.length)
}
displayMovieAndTech()
//Output : 2 + 17 buttons

//We can even combine selectors like classes, tags, or ID. A button tage name will display its text in the console for example.

//When querySelectorAll(".movie, .tech") : it returns elements of either class .movie or .tech ! We can combine inside querySelectoreAll, all types of selectors as long as they separated by a comma.

/*
There's a reason why we haven't used setAttribute() to set classes. If we use it to change a class, it overrides the previous class. We can see the issue if we run this code and try to make the text display as both bold and italic.

*There's a better way to add and remove classes and it's with property called classList.

*To add a new class without overriding the previous one, we have to add the classList property. We can then use it to access the add() method.

*Inside the add() method, we code the class we want to add to the element.

*Code bold to add the class once you call the function.

*Classes can be removed from an element as well. To remove a class, code the remove() method.

*If we want to automatically add or remove a class when we call the function, we can use the toggle() method. 
*/

function addBold() {
	let element20 = document.querySelector("#stylechanging")
	element20.classList.add("bold")
}
addBold()

function removeBold() {
	let element21 = document.querySelector("#stylechanging")
	element21.classList.remove("bold")
}

function toggleBold() {
	let element22 = document.querySelector("#stylechanging")
	element22.classList.toggle("bold")
}

//We can add multiple classes to an element at the same time. Let's add two new classes to our paragraph element. We can easily remove multiple classes as well by add remove()

function addClasses() {
	let element23 = document.querySelector("#style1")
	element23.classList.add("highlight", "underline")
}

//To recap, setAttribute() overwrites the element's classes while classList don't.
