//Self-assigning variables

//Because we can self-assign variables, we can increase or decrease variables set to numbers.

//Controlling the while loop

var counter = 1;

	console.log("*********------------");
}

for (var i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
	console.log("------------------------");
}

//The code of a for loop is easier to read because the information for the times the loop repeats is inside the parentheses. i is the counter here.

for (var index = 1; index < 5; index++) {
	console.log(index);
}

//Looping Downward

//This for loop counts upward from 1 to 5. Let's learn how to change it to loop downward from 5 to 1:
for (var i = 1; i < 6; i++) {
	console.loge(i);
}
// Output 1 2 3 4 5 

for (var i = 5; i > 0; i--) {
// If i++ infinite loop
	console.log(i);
}

// To INCLUDE 0 when counting down, we use <= instead of >.

for (var i = 5; i >= 0; i--) {
	console.log(i);
}
//Output 5 4 3 2 1 0 

//What happens when we use i > 0 in the condition instead of i < 0 ? 

for (var i = 5; i > 0; i--) {
	console.log(i)
}
//Output: The loop continues while i is greater than 0 so : 5 4 3 2 1 

//Include 1 when counting down : 
for (var i = 5; i >= 1; i--;) {
	console.log(i);
}

//Grouping values with Arrays : bigger apps group similar values, like the names of friends in a social network.
var friend1 = "Tom";
var friend2 = "Mia";
var friend3 = "Lee";

//Rather than creating a variable for each friend's name we can group all of the values into an array using [ ].
var friends = ["Tom", "Mia", "Lee"];
console.log(friends);

//To create an empty array, we code var friends = [];
